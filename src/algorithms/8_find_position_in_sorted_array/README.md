use binary search,  calculating midpoints and diving the integers into two parts.
comparing the value of midpoints to target and shrinking boundaries. 

firstly, find start or left index of target. Then, find  end or right index of target.

initialize index to negative 1, and if we find the position of target, we will change the index value.
